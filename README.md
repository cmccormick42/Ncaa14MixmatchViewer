# Ncaa14MixmatchViewer
A utility to view uniform mixmatch files for NCAA14.

This is a C# Windows Forms Application that you can build using Visual Studio.

# How to use
- Launch the application.
- From the File menu, select Load.
- Choose a valid mixmatch XML file from the dialog and click Open. Data will load into the tables.

You can select a preset name from the list on the left to filter the uniform parts to only those belonging to the preset.
To reset the filter, click a blank spot under the Presets list.

# Future Plans
I would like to make the data tables editable so that you can save any changes.
